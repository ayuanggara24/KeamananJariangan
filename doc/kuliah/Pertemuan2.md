Vulnerabilities in computer security, vulnerabilities are a weakness that allows an attacker to reduce information security system. Vulnerabilities is the intersection of three elements :. Vulnerabilities system or defective, the attacker access for the handicapped, and the ability of an attacker to exploit the flaw to exploit vulnerabilities, an attacker must have at least one valid tool or technique that can connect to the weakness of the system. Vulnerabilities in the vulnerability also known as the attack surface.

In TCP / IP all port-based, for the Application Layer itself there are HTTP, port 80, FTP: port 21 and SSH: port 22, for the Transport Layer are TCP / IP, for Internet Layer are IP Address, and for Network Access Layer are MAC address.

Function MAC Address is used for communication networks such as the local user or a PC with the router being used.

There was also a ARP Table. That where ARP Table here serves to transform the existing IP Address into the MAC Address.

In the network security there are also DNS, DNS herein may be employed in which people who are not responsible to do the 'hack' for DNS Weakness in computer networks is the domain address used can be spoofed using a different IP address.

How to check the DNS or MAC address that is by using a command prompt in Windows us. To check the MAC address simply by typing arp -a and to check that nslookup namaaddrees DNS.
