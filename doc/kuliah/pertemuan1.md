# OSI vs TCP/IP

**OSI** is a communication standard that is applied in a computer network. 
Standard that causes the entire communication devices can communicate with each other over the network.

**TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a protocol that governs a group of computers 
in the data communications. TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a protocol that governs a group of computer data communications on the Internet.


As we know one of the differences between TCP / IP and OSI is on its layer. 
That where OSI has 7 layers, and TCP / IP only has 4 Layers. But the goal is the same as having to share any information or data using the network method.


TCP / IP is more popular than OSI because TCP / IP is a set of protocols that enable communication between computers, TCP / IP became very popular because if we want to connect to the Internet we must use the TCP / IP protocol, the TCP / IP is then computers around the world can communicate with each other. TCP / IP is increasingly popular among developers and users, therefore the need for standardization.
