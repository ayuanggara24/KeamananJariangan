Anatomy of the hacking is done sequential stages in the process of hacking. There are five stages in the anatomy of hacking:



1. Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the data collection phase targets to get the information as much as possible and get a gap to attack the target.

2. Scanning
The next stage is scanning, where hackers gather information network with more specific victims and to search for any possible take over the victim's system

3. Gaining Access
At the stage of Gaining Access, hackers began to penetrate and try to control the sacrificial system of the weaknesses derived from the scanning process.

4. Maintaining Access
This is the stage where the hacker has mastered the sacrificial system and to ensure that hackers can still access and control of a victim's system, although the victim make improvements to the system.

5. Clearing Tracks
At this stage, the hacker begins to lose his trail, so victims do not feel there is something wrong in the system.
